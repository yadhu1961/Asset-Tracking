# Asset-Tracking
Repository contains code developed for Asset tracking project. It is an application developed on Contiki OS. The mote used is Zolertia Remote


In large enterprises, the main problem is to track the assets. Asset tracking solution allows users to view enterprise assets located across multiple locations. The solution was designed to provide real-time visibility and control of all high-value and/or mission-critical assets to help increase asset and labour optimization in many different enterprises.

The project provides solution for tracking of assets in the big enterprises in an efficient way. Assets are considered as moving wireless nodes and so visible to tracking wireless nodes which form a network. We use ad hoc distance vector protocol for dynamic â€“energy aware routing between nodes of the network. There are two types of nodes gateway nodes and asset tracking nodes. Asset tracking nodes forward asset information to gateway through shortest path calculated based on distance and energy awareness. The project is implemented using networking operating system Contiki which is based on protothreads, event driven programming model hence ideally suited for low power/resource constrained embedded systems.
