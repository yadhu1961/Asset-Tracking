Project A\+S\+T\+RA – Asset Tracking for hospitals 

 \hypertarget{index_s0}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_s0}
Introduction to the project. To track mobile medical equipments in the hospitals Increased patient volume, increased health care devices which are prone to misplacements by humans. Misplacements, time to track, central inventory management(out of date, over ordering, needs maintenance or disposal).
